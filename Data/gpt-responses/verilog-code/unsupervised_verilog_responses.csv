You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:

",4610,"It looks like the given code is not in Verilog, but VHDL. Therefore, assertions cannot be added in the same format as Verilog. However, I can suggest some VHDL assertions which may be helpful:

1) Assert proper values initialization:
Assertion:
```vhdl
assert F1 = 3
    report ""F1 should be initialized with the value 3""
    severity FAILURE;
```
Reasoning:
To ensure that `F1` is initialized correctly during execution.

2) Assert proper types for scalar and complex functions:
For `complex_scalar` function:
Assertion:
```vhdl
assert s'length = 16
    report ""Input to complex_scalar function must be of length 16""
    severity FAILURE;
```
Reasoning:
To verify the input length to the function matches its expected size.

For `scalar_complex` function:
Assertion:
```vhdl
assert s = 3 or s = 4
    report ""Input to scalar_complex function must be 3 or 4""
    severity FAILURE;
```
Reasoning:
To ensure that only valid integers from the variables are used as inputs in the function.

Please note that the "":= 3"" and "":= 4"" don't appear to be valid variable identifiers. So, these aren't used in the assertions. It seems there might be an error or misunderstanding with those variables. Please verify them."

",['FALSE'],1,"['nt.""']",1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['nt.""']

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

Example Output:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

sequence sr1;

",3636,"The provided code is in VHDL, not Verilog. As such, it's not possible to generate assertions per the given instruction which applies to Verilog code.
However, if we apply some of the same principles to the VHDL code, here could be some possible assertions:

1) Assert that the size of 'C27' is equal to 16 (since it's declared as a time_vector_st which ranges from 0 to 15).
2) Assert that each element of 'C27' is equal to 'C4' (since 'C27' is set to be an array of 'C4').

Although these are applicable scenarios to assert, note that VHDL doesn't support assertions in the same way as Verilog does. Instead, VHDL uses 'assert' statements to check for a condition and if the condition is False, it performs an action such as printing a message. Here's a VHDL-style example of how the above scenarios could be asserted:

1) Code:
```
assert C27'length = 16
  report ""The length of the time_vector_st 'C27' is not 16.""
  severity ERROR;
```

2) Code:
```
for i in C27'range loop
  assert C27(i) = C4
    report ""Element "" & integer'image(i) & "" of 'C27' is not equal to 'C4'.""
    severity ERROR;
end loop;
```

These pieces of code are not valid in Verilog, but they give an example of how 'assert' statements can be used in VHDL. In Verilog, assertions are often used to define properties which should hold true throughout the execution of the code and are evaluated at specific times relative to the clock cycle."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

sequence sr1;

Example Output:

Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",3518,"The provided code is written in VHDL, not Verilog, and as such, it involves quite some different concepts and mechanisms. But if we were to provide assertions, it would be something like following format:

1) [1, fail, 0, ""Fail variable should be initially 0 because no failure has occured yet""]
2) [1 to 100, vtime, 1994 ns, ""VTime should be 1994 ns as read from the file""]
3) [After loop, fail, 1 or 0, ""If any test case fails, fail should be 1 else it should stay as 0""]

But please note that this type of assertions is not directly supported in VHDL as it is presented here. This assertion format more closely mirrors the structure of assertions in languages like Python. In VHDL, instead of this, we use 'assert' statements with conditions and messages inside the code itself."

",['FALSE'],1,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

",3052,"The provided code is written in VHDL, which differs significantly in structure and methodology from Verilog. That, in addition to the fact that the code doesn't have any clear inputs or outputs, means that it's not possible to provide relevant assertions in the format requested. Verilog assertions cannot be used in VHDL code. For VHDL, the concept of assertions is different, and is usually used to test internal conditions within the code using assert statements. 
To provide helpful insights on this code, it should be written in Verilog, so that relevant Verilog assertions can be developed. 

This input doesn't fit within the description given, as it's VHDL code not Verilog, it also doesn't have inputs or outputs."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['', ')', ':= 0']

",5272,"This appears to be VHDL code which is a different language from Verilog. Additionally, the provided variables: ['', ')', ':= 0'] don't seem to directly relate to the code and there are no clear criteria for assertions. Therefore, no assertions can be generated. However, assuming assertions can be exchanged into VHDL, here are few that could be useful based on the information I can extract:

[['F1', 3, integer, ""Assert that F1 output is initialized to 3""],
 ['F3', C19, time_cons_vectorofvector, ""Assert that F3 takes the data type time_cons_vectorofvector""],
 ['FF', 0, integer, ""Assert that FF output is initialized to 0""],
 ['S1', C19, time_cons_vectorofvector, ""Assert that S1 signal takes the data type time_cons_vectorofvector""],
 ['S3', integer, None, ""Assert that the S3 signal is taking integer values""],
 ['SS', 0, integer, ""Assert that SS signal is initialized to 0""]]

Again, these are hypothetical and may require modifications to properly fit into the code, given that assertions and the expected format presented in the request are different in VHDL from Verilog."

",4488,"Since the provided code is in VHDL and not Verilog, it's not possible to add assertions in the same style that would be used in Verilog. 

However, VHDL has its own mechanism for checking properties of the design using Assertion Statement. An assertion in VHDL is a way of adding checks into the design and trapping unexpected behavior before it can cause further problems.

The assertions for the provided VHDL code in VHDL format would be as follows:

[""K"",""1"", ""K should be '1' when the end of file is encountered too soon""]
[""VAR"",""CON"", ""Variable VAR should be equal to constant CON in every loop iteration""]
[""K"",""1"",""K should be '1' if the end of file has not been reached yet""]
  
which corresponds to the following VHDL code:

Assert (K = 1) report ""Hit the end of file too soon"" severity ERROR;
Assert (VAR = CON) report ""Variable VAR is not equal to constant CON"" severity ERROR;
Assert (K = 1) report ""Have not reached end of file yet"" severity ERROR;

Note, that Boolean results of the assertion evaluations were not used in VHDL code as they would change the behaviour, that's why are skipped in the translated version."

",3460,"I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided code seems to be VHDL, not Verilog. Also, VHDL doesn't support assertions in the same way as Verilog does. However, if we try to translate the VHDL style of checking into Verilog, this might look like:

[['PROCESS', 'm', 'CHAR_RECORD', ""m should be initialized as CHAR_RECORD""], 
 ['PROCESS', 'k', 0, ""k should be initialized as 0""], 
 ['PROCESS', 'k', 5, ""k should change its value to 5 when condition is met""]]

However, please note that the Verilog syntax is significantly different from VHDL and lacks certain operators and architecture habitually present in VHDL. The transition or correspondence is not one-to-one and certain details may vary. As for time instance or clock cycle checks - those are not commonplace in VHDL, so they were not included in the translated response."

",['false'],1,"[':= log2(NINP)', ':= 1', ':= 100 ns', ':= 8']",4,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= log2(NINP)', ':= 1', ':= 100 ns', ':= 8']
*Code:

",['false'],1,"[':= 8', ':= 100 ns', ':= 1', ':= ENGN_CFGLEN', ':= (CFGWIDTH-1)/SLCWIDTH+1', ':= 10']",6,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 8', ':= 100 ns', ':= 1', ':= ENGN_CFGLEN', ':= (CFGWIDTH-1)/SLCWIDTH+1', ':= 10']

","['false report ""simulation ended"" severity failure;']",1,"[':= 0', ':= 10 ns']",2,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0', ':= 10 ns']
*Code:

",6883,"Based on the provided piece of Verilog code, here are the list of assertions concerning the variables in the code:

Please note that these assertions are essential for validating the size of signals and the consistency of certain features in the logic design. 

To perform these checks in your code, you can use the built-in assert statement in Verilog with the format: `assert(<condition>) else <statement>` where `<condition>` is the condition to check and `<statement>` is the statement to execute if the condition fails."

",2956,"Given the provided Verilog code, it is clear that the purpose of the verification is to test the component ""cordic_commander"". So assertions can be applied to that testing block to ensure all inputs and outputs are satisfied correctly. 

Here are suggested assertions:

1) [""clk"", '0', None, ""clk should be '0' before start of every pattern""]
2) [""clk"", '1', None, ""clk should be '1' after start of every pattern""]
3) [""mode"", patterns(i).m, None, ""mode should have value assigned as the pattern value""]
4) [""angle"", None, 32, ""angle should be 32 bit output from the cordic_commander block""]

The above four assertions are made based on the given inputs and outputs of the cordic_commander component. They assure us that inputs are delivered properly and output is generated correctly in terms of size. Also the clock signals at the start and end of every pattern are as expected. 

It is important to note that, for tests with more intricate functionality details, more assertions might be necessary. These assertions mentioned can be a starting point for more extensive validation and verification activities. 

Add these assertions to the block of code test the 'cordic_commander' component."

","['false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false']",6,['or'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

1. STATE SPACE

  Since the values of data inputs have little influence on the functioning 
  of DUT, they are kept constant and not varied. The select input should be 
  a one hot code and is varied from 00..1 to 10..0.

2. PARAMETERIZATION

  The parameter WIDTH_P is the width of the data input and ELS_P is the 
  number of inputs to the mux which in this case is equal to the width of the 
  select input. Since the DUT deals with the data inputs of different widths 
  similarly, an arbitrary set of tests that include edge cases would suffice. 
  So a minimum set of tests might be WIDTH_P = 1,2,3,4 and ELS_P = 2,3,4.

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 3 ns)', ':= 40 ns', 'range 0 to 2**M - 1 := 0']
*Code:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 10000000', ':= 1', ':= 0', ':= 0 ns', ':= 1 ns']
*Code:

2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:

*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;

sequence sr1;

Example Output:

",4385,"Since Verilog does not have built-in set of assertions like SystemVerilog's 'assert' keyword, let's consider the provided code in VHDL. The assertions will be added according to the state and the values of the input and output signals at the positive edge of the clock cycle:

[""@(posedge clk)"", ""rst"", '1', ""Reset signal should be high to initialize.""]
[""@(posedge clk)"", ""enc"", '0', ""Encryption signal should be low for starting.""]
[""@(posedge clk)"", ""block_in"", None, ""block_in should have valid data.""]
[""@(posedge clk)"", ""key"", None, ""key should have valid data.""]
[""@(posedge clk)"", ""v_0_out.size"", 32, ""v_0_out should be 32 bits.""]
[""@(posedge clk)"", ""v_1_out.size"", 32, ""v_1_out should be 32 bits.""] 

This assertions translate into below VHDL assert statements:

assert rst = '1' report ""Assert failed because Reset signal is not high to initialize."" severity failure;
assert enc = '0' report ""Assert failed because Encryption signal is not low for starting."" severity failure;
assert block_in'length = 64 report ""Assert failed because block_in does not have valid data."" severity failure;
assert key'length = 128 report ""Assert failed because key does not have valid data."" severity failure;
assert v_0_out'length = 32 report ""Assert failed because v_0_out size is not correct."" severity failure;
assert v_1_out'length = 32 report ""Assert failed because v_1_out size is not correct."" severity failure;"

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;

property pr1;

endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",3219,"I'm sorry, but this code is written in VHDL, not Verilog. It's not possible to add assertions to a VHDL code using Verilog assertions directly.

Although code looks erroneous, as the extra parenthesis cannot compile, I can't generate practical assertions based on the provided information and the code you shared because:

1) There are no functional signals or ports available except the generic clause with integer input `i`.
2) There is not any information related to timing or clock signal to relate 'timing' in the assertion response.
3) The VHDL code provided does not seem to process any functionality or logic that we can assert on.

Given that hardware description language assertions usually check the behaviour of logic under specific conditions, more information or a different, functional VHDL or Verilog code, would be needed to provide useful assertions."

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:

 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None

Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

sequence sr1;

Example Output:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",4145,"Unfortunately, I can't provide assertions for this piece of code because it's written in Coq, a formal proof management system, not in Verilog. The assertion generation described is specific to Verilog, a hardware description language. Assertions in Coq proofs and Verilog code are quite different – e.g., in Coq we use tactics to verify assertions at each step of the proof, while in Verilog we embed them directly into the code to be checked during simulation. Therefore, I need Verilog code in order to generate appropriate assertions."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",3779,"Given the lack of any kind of clock signal and the usage of specific processes in the given VHDL (not Verilog) code, we'll be addressing assertions in terms of chronological order and the code's intrinsic nature itself. Here's what could be of help:

[""line 14"", x, 123, ""After first read, variable x should hold the value 123""]
[""line 20"", x, -123, ""After reading a negative integer, variable x should hold the value -123""]
[""line 28"", x, integer'low, ""After reading the low limit of integer, variable x should hold the value equal to integer'low""]
[""line 28"", c, ',', ""The character read after the integer should be a comma""]
[""line 40"", x, INTEGER error, ""Reading only a minus sign should result in an INTEGER error""]
[""line 48"", x, INTEGER error, ""Reading a trailing minus sign should result in an INTEGER error""]
[""check_bool process start"", x, TRUE, ""After reading a boolean true, variable x should be true""]
[""check_real process start"", x, 5.152, ""After reading a float value, variable x should hold the value 5.152""]
[""check_bit_vector process start"", x, ""1010"", ""After reading a bit_vector, variable x should hold the value 1010""]

These suggestions assert the expected program behavior along with its chronological execution steps. This includes checking that correct values are read into the correct variables, making errors evident when improperly formatting input, and verifying that the required values are obtained when reading data from a line."

","['(false) report ""Input file finished."" severity failure;']",1,"[':= 100.0e6', ':= 1.0 sec /(2.0*c_input_freq)']",2,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;

Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",['false'],1,[':= 20 ns'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 8', ':= 256', ':= 10 ns', ':= 2 ** width', 'range 0 to 255']
*Code:

","['NOT(fail = 0)', '(fail = 0)']",2,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",4727,"The code you have provided is in VHDL, not Verilog. It's important to note that these are two different Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and they have unique syntax and structure. Therefore, I must mention that the criteria for creating assertions in VHDL is different from the criteria in Verilog.

However, I'll attempt to create assertions for your VHDL code:

1) ['1 ns', 's_t_a', boolean, ""s_t_a should be able to hold a logic state at each nanosecond""]
The reasoning behind this assertion is that s_t_a is a std_logic signal, which should be able to hold a binary state at all instances during simulation. This is ensured by checking the state every nanosecond.

2) ['1 ns', 's_t_b', boolean, ""s_t_b should be able to hold a logic state at each nanosecond""]
Similar to s_t_a, s_t_b should also be able to hold a state throughout the simulation.

3) ['1 ns', 's_t_c', boolean, ""s_t_c should be able to hold a logic state at each nanosecond""]
s_t_c is the output of OR gate. This assertion checks that at every nanosecond, s_t_c also holds a binary value.

Note that these assertions are made based on the timing check at every 1ns, being the smallest time measure used in this code where the logic state of the variables are evaluated. VHDL simulation is discrete-event and it uses a global simulation queue, so timing in VHDL is not necessarily related to real time, this is why it is measured in nanoseconds (ns). However, the timing requirements for your specific design may require you to adjust the checking period."

","['false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false']",6,['or'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['or']
*Code:

",7389,"Based on the provided Verilog code, a few assertions that could be added to ensure proper functionality can be as follows:

- Ensure that the `wr_clk` and `rd_clk` signals oscillate correctly.
- Ensure that the `reset` signal behaves as expected.
- Make sure the `status` signal's value is well controlled.
- Assert that the program does not hang indefinitely (deadlock state).

The list of assertions for the provided Verilog code thus includes:

[['wr_clk', 1, None, 'wr_clk should be high at half cycle'],
 ['wr_clk', 0, None, 'wr_clk should be low at half cycle'],
 ['rd_clk', 1, None, 'rd_clk should be high at half cycle'],
 ['rd_clk', 0, None, 'rd_clk should be low at half cycle'],
 ['reset',  1, None, 'reset should be high at the start of the reset cycle'],
 ['reset',  0, None, 'reset should be low at the end of the reset cycle'],
 ['status', '0', None, 'status should either be 0 or 1 at all times'],
 ['status', '1', None, 'status should either be 0 or 1 at all times'],
 ['sim_done', 0, '1', ""Simulation should be done. Check for deadlock after 100 ms of operation""]]

These assertions can help catch common errors in system timing and system logic, and ensure that the system operates as expected. It is important to note, however, that additional assertions could be considered based on the specific requirements of the design. For example, assertions can be created to validate the correct functionality of the instantiated `fg_tb_synth` core and its interaction with its environment."

","['(false) report ""Input file finished."" severity failure;']",1,"[':= 120.0e6', ':= 1.0 sec / (2.0 * c_input_freq)']",2,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 120.0e6', ':= 1.0 sec / (2.0 * c_input_freq)']
*Code:

",4630,"The provided code doesn't seem to contain any suitable target for assertion addition as per the provided directive. The input doesn't appear to be a valid Verilog code but rather seems like VHDL code, and there's no clearly defined function or process that manipulates variables which could be checked with assertions. 

However, considering the conceptual functionality of the code, if we were to generate assertions, one potential assertion could deal with input/output sizes of the scalar and complex functions defined. 

Remember, these are hypothetical assertions and may not directly apply in the VHDL context:

1) [start, complex_scalar(s : s2positive_cons_vector), 1, ""The complex_scalar function should always return an integer""]
2) [start, scalar_complex(s : integer), length(C1), ""The scalar_complex function should return a vector of same length as constant C1""]

Kindly provide more information or valid Verilog code for more accurate assertions."

","['DWIDTH=8 or DWIDTH=9', '(DWIDTH=8 or DWIDTH=9)"" severity failure;']",2,"[':= 0', 'nt,']",2,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0', 'nt,']
*Code:

",6116,"Given the complexity of the VHDL code, it can be difficult to infer the exact functionality without explicit knowledge. However, I can provide general assertions that are crucial to operations:

1) ['CLK', '1', None, ""Clock cycle must always be in valid state""]
   
   This assertion ensures that the clock is always in a valid state. A good design would usually have the clock not dependent on any conditions.
   
2) ['ENA', '1', None, ""Enable signal must be ready for monitor output""]
  
   This assertion ensures that the monitor is ready for outputs. This might be important if other components depend on the validity of ENA.
   
3) ['RL_DI', RL_DI'left to RL_DI'right, None, ""RLink data in must be within valid range""]
   
   This assertion ensures that the RLink data in always falls within the valid range. This is important for the proper functioning of RL_DI. 
   
4) ['RL_DO', RL_DO'left to RL_DO'right, None, ""RLink data out must be within valid range""]
   
   This assertion ensures that the RLink data out also falls within the valid range. It is important that output data maintains integrity.
   
5) ['nbusy', nbusy >= 0, None, ""Number of busy signals must be non-negative""]
   
   This assertion ensures that the number of busy signals represented by ""nbusy"" stays non-negative. In this context, it wouldn’t make sense to have a negative count of busy signals.
   
6) ['nhold', nhold >= 0, None, ""Number of hold signals must be non-negative""]
   
   Similar to the assertion for ""nbusy"", this assertion checks that the number of hold signals stays non-negative.

Please note that these are just general assertions and may not completely align with your design constraints. You might need to modify them or add more specific assertions based on your design needs."

",['(data_width_p % 8 == 0)'],1,['unused = reset_i'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

","[""x'stable;"", ""x'quiet;"", ""x'transaction = '1';"", ""x'delayed(1 ns) = '1';""]",4,['is x'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['is x']

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;

Example Output:

Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",['FALSE'],1,"['nt.""']",1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",3181,"The provided code seems to be VHDL and not Verilog, hence Verilog based assertions would not fit here. However, if we were to generate similar assertions for this code, they would look like:

Assert that 'X' is a BIT type:
[Test Condition: X = '0' or '1', Reason: Input 'X' should be of BIT type]

Assert that 'Z' is a BIT type:
[Test condition: Z = '0' or '1', Reason: Linkage 'Z' should be of BIT type]

Assert that 'COUT' is a BIT type:
[Test condition: COUT = '0' or '1', Reason: Output 'COUT' should be of BIT type]

This would make sure the right types are used for input, linkage and output.

Assertions specific to the method structure, its inputs and outputs, and behavior would require a further detailed Verilog code with defined methods. The provided VHDL code is currently testing for incorrect usage and does not allow for such assertions."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

end process p;
end only;
",1704,"There seem to be some confusion. The supplied code is written in VHDL (another hardware description language), whereas the topic mentions Verilog. They are similar in purpose, but they use very different syntaxes. I will give it a go anyways. 

The VHDL code does not contain any outputs, signals, or assignments. It basically defines a range of integers (1 to 3) and a test process which just reports ""TEST PASSED"". There are no assertions that can be made in terms of signals or variables over a clock cycle, since the VHDL does not contain any such elements.

However, we can imply that the value of 'small' should always be within the range of 1 to 3 based on the 'small' subtype definition. If we were to use a sort of universal format to specify this, it could look something like:

['continuous', small, 'within 1 and 3', ""Value of 'small' should always be within the range""]

Please note that VHDL does not use assertions in the same way that you've described in your prompt. Instead, it uses something called 'assert' statement where you can check if conditions are valid and display a message if not. The VHDL equivalent of an assertion checking 'small' lies within the range would be:

assert small >= 1 and small <= 3 report ""Value of 'small' is out of range"" severity ERROR; 

This would go at some point where 'small' is being used in the code. If this was to be in a process, 'small' would likely be a signal and we would check the value on each clock cycle inside the process, for example:

...
p: process (clk)
begin  -- process p
  if rising_edge(clk) then
    assert small >= 1 and small <= 3 report ""Value of 'small' is out of range"" severity ERROR;
  end if;
end process p;
... 

Here the assertion checks, at each rising edge of the 'clk' signal, that the value of 'small' is between 1 and 3, reporting an error if not."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['unused = reset_i']
*Code:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['range -8 to 7 := -7', 'range -8 to 7 :=  5', 'range -8 to 7 := -8', 'range -8 to 7 :=  7']
