","['false report ""end of simulation"" severity failure;']",1,[':= 33'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 33']
*Code:

	end process;
end;
",1722,"There are very limited assertions that can be made given the provided code, as it does not define specific relationships between its variables or actually use its variable in any complex processes. Here is what can be done:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['[check_bytes_p*channel_width_p-1:0] data_in_check', 'one_o']
*Code:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['', 'range lowb to highb', 'range lowb_i2 to highb_i2', 'variable', 'range <>', ':= 8.0', ':= 0.0', ':= 1.0', ':= 5', ':= 1000', ':= 1', ':= -100', ':= 2 ns', ':= 1000.0', ':= 80.0', ':= 0', ':= highb', 'range <>) of st_int1', ':= lowb', ':= 1 ns']
*Code:

",['FALSE'],1,['range ) of real'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

",3240,"Given the instructions, there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding. Verilog and VHDL are two different hardware description languages. The input provided is VHDL, not Verilog. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to provide assertions as if it was Verilog code.

Additionally, the code provided contains no signals or variables capable of formulating assertions, rather, it's a VHDL test case code which lacks correct syntax (hence the box (<>)).

In the situation where Verilog code was provided, a potential example could look like this:

*Variables:
[clk, a, b, c]
*Code:
assign c = a & b;
always @(posedge clk) begin
  a <= b;
  b <= c;
end

From this, assertions could be generated such as:

[[0, a, b, 'a should be equal to b on the positive edge of the clock'],
 [0, b, c, 'b should be equal to c on the positive edge of the clock']]

These assertions would be checking for conditions necessary for the operation to work correctly, in line with the given constraints."

",3164,"The provided code is written in VHDL, not Verilog, so traditional Verilog assertions can't be applied here. However, in VHDL, we can use asserts in a similar way to verify properties or conditions within the code. Since the only variable identified within the given code is ""i"", generated assertions will be made on it. 

Since VHDL doesn't have built-in timing features like Verilog does, the timing factor used in VHDL assertions will generally represent the occurrence of a specific event rather than a specific clock cycle.

Based on the code, the following assertions may be created:

1. ['i', 0, None, ""i should be initialized to 0""]
2. ['i', 10, None, ""i should be set to 10 in return_exp_check procedure""]

",['FALSE'],1,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

","['false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false']",6,['or'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['or']
*Code:

",7073,"Given the complexity of the Verilog code provided and considering the requirements for the inputs, the following assertions could be added:

1) [0, reset, None, ""Check if reset assertion is made at the start of every clock cycle""]

Assert that the reset variable is correctly set to '1' at the start of every clock cycle after reset has occurred. This ensures the system is in a known state at all times.

2) [wr_clk_period_by_2, wr_clk, '1', ""Assert that the write clock is high at the midpoint of every clock cycle""]

3) [wr_clk_period_by_2, wr_clk, '0', ""Assert that the write clock is low at the start and end of each clock cycle""]

4) [0, sim_done, None, ""Sim_done should be asserted before simulation begins""] 

It's crucial to ensure that the simulation will end properly. The system must be properly reset before simulation reaches its terminal state.

5) [0, status, None, ""Status should be checked at the beginning of every clock cycle""]

The status variable represents an important output that should be constantly monitored. At the beginning of each clock cycle, it should be checked for consistency.

Since the structure of the response asked is a list i.e. [timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning], the assertions can be represented as:

Assertions=
[ 
  [0, ""reset"", None, ""Check if reset assertion is made at the start of every clock cycle""],
  [wr_clk_period_by_2, ""wr_clk"", '1', ""Assert that the write clock is high at the midpoint of every clock cycle""],
  [wr_clk_period_by_2, ""wr_clk"", '0', ""Assert that the write clock is low at the start and end of each clock cycle""],
  [0, ""sim_done"", None, ""Sim_done should be asserted before simulation begins""],
  [0, ""status"", None, ""Status should be checked at the beginning of every clock cycle""]
].

Each list can be converted into an assertion:
  assert property(@(posedge clk) reset |=> ('0')) else $display(""Check if reset assertion is made at the start of every clock cycle"");
  assert property(@(posedge wr_clk) wr_clk === 1'b1) else $display(""Assert that the write clock is high at the midpoint of every clock cycle"");
  assert property(@(negedge wr_clk) wr_clk === 1'b0) else $display(""Assert that the write clock is low at the start and end of each clock cycle"");
  assert property(@(posedge clk) sim_done |-> sim_done === 1'b1) else $display(""Sim_done should be asserted before simulation begins"");
  assert property(@(posedge clk) status |-> status !== 8'bxxxx_xxxx) else $display(""Status should be checked at the beginning of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

-- Description:	Test report module
--
-- See also the gaiser.sim.ahbrep module for a module connected via AHB for
-- for use internally on SoC.
--
-- This module supports a 16- or 32-bit interface as selected via the 'width'
-- generic. 
--
-- In 32-bit mode the module has the following memory map:
--
--  0x00 : sets and prints vendor id from data[31:24] and
--         device id from data[23:12]
--  0x08 : calls subtest data[7:0]
--  0x10 : prints *** GRLIB system test starting ***
--  0x14 : prints Test passed / errors detected
--  0x18 : prints Checkpoint data[15:0] with time stamp
--
-- In 16-bit mode the module has the following memory map:
--
--  0x00 : sets vendor id from data[15:8] and MSbs of device id from data[7:0]
--  0x08 : calls subtest data[7:0]
--  0x0C : sets LSbs of device id from data[15:12], prints vendor and device id
--  0x10 : prints *** GRLIB system test starting ***
--  0x14 : prints Test passed / errors detected 
--  0x18 : prints Checkpoint data[15:0] with time stamp
--
-- The width is defined for the systest software via GRLIB_REPORTDEV_WIDTH

","['false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false']",6,['or'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['or']

",6793,"Based on the provided VHDL code, there are no sufficient variable instantiations provided to create meaningful assertions. Correct assertions would not be possible due to a lack of information about the specific use of the variables and their expected behaviors or properties.

However, in a general sense and based on the VHDL code structure, potential assertions could look like this:

['clk', '0', '1', ""System's clock must be initialized and running for processes to function.""]
['abits', 'integer', None, ""Address bits variable should be of integer type.""]
['dbits', 'integer', None, ""Data bits variable should be of integer type.""]
['address', 'std_logic_vector', None, ""Address should be a std_logic_vector type.""]
['datain', 'std_logic_vector', None, ""Data input should be a std_logic_vector type.""]
['dataout', 'std_logic_vector', None, ""Data output should be a std_logic_vector type.""]

Note: These are just examples based on hypothetical situations. In an actual code evaluation scenario, more information (and specific assertions) may be necessary based on the code's logic and requirements."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",4302,"Given the Verilog code above, it is difficult to generate any meaningful assertions because of the following reasons:

1) The provided input does not have any continuous assignments or any assigned input or output channels that we could establish baselines for.

2) The port list of the defined ENTITY is empty, which means there are no external connections to the module.

3) No specific functional design in the given code, but a ""TESTING"" process.

The function does not seem to depend on any inputs, but rather a file ""iofile.28"" that it reads from, and there are no clear outputs that the function is generating. However, we can see that variable v is being read from the file and its value is being compared with the constant C27, so we might be able to add an assertion checking if v is equal to C27 which could limit possible bugs in the reading operation:

[[0, v, C27, ""v should be equal to C27 after each read operation""], [at the end of the loop, k, 1, ""If v was not equal to C27 at any point, k should be 1""]] 

Please note that these generated assertions are based on the understanding of the code provided and may not be accurate or meaningful due to the limitations mentioned above."

 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['[width_p-1:0] s1 [items_p-1:0]', '[width_p-1:0] s2 [items_p-1:0]', '3[3]', '3[0]', '=', 'swapped_3_1', '0', '[width_p-1:0] s0 [items_p-1:0]', '[width_p-1:0] s3 [items_p-1:0]']
*Code:

//
// bsg_sort
//
// This is a sorting network implementation.

",4007,"It seems there is a confusion here. The given code is in VHDL (a language for describing hardware, particularly for FPGA programming). As such, it doesn't specifically relate to assertions as they are handled in a more software-oriented language like Python or Java.

However, trying to adapt to what assertions might look like in this context could look like this:

[1, 'k', 1, ""If a non-'s' character is read, k should be set to 1""]
[1, 'filein', None, ""filein should be successfully opened and readable""]
[100, 'v', None, ""all characters in the file should be read within 100 cycles""]
[None, 'filein', None, ""at the end, filein reading operation should be successful or it will be an error""]

These would mean checking the subsequent conditions at specified points in time or at the end of execution to ensure accuracy. 

This set of ""assertions"" would keep an eye on whether the file reading was successful, whether the character variable 'v' traverses every character in the file and finally, if the setting of 'k' to 1 is functioning in the cases specified (when a non-'s' character is encountered). 

Please note that assertions in this sense don't exist in VHDL and it's more appropriate to deal with these kind of checks within the framework of error handling and debugging functionality VHDL includes, like reporting or severity levels."

",['FALSE'],1,[':= 122903 )'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",3160,"Unfortunately, the provided code doesn't appear to be in Verilog, but rather it is in VHDL, another hardware description language. Also, it lacks properly defined variables and outputs, thus no properly formed assertions can be made based on this code. Assertions require clearly defined variables, functions, or operations to work with which are not present in the given VHDL code.

Additionally, it is noted that := 122903 seems to be an assignment operation rather than a variable declaration, but without a clear variable to assert, it is impossible to form an assertion based on it. Furthermore, in a VHDL context, generics can be assumed as parameters to guide designs or configurations, but again they are not available in the given context for an assertion."

",3159,"The provided code is in VHDL, which doesn't have native support for assertions as described in the prompt. VHDL assertions most commonly use the 'assert' keyword unlike the format [""timing"", ""subject_variable"", ""target"", ""reasoning""].

However, for future reference, if we consider this VHDL code is equivalent to a hypothetical Verilog code. We will probably have the following assertions:

[1, 'k', 0, ""Initially, the variable k is set to 0""],
[1, 'i', None, ""Verifying loop variable 'i' is correctly incremented from 1 to 10 each loop iteration""],
['A', None, None, ""The exit condition should be Boolean type""]

Please note that these are hypothetical assertions in the requested format, actually adding these into VHDL or even Verilog would require significant language-specific modifications."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0', ':= v']

",['false'],1,"[':= 0)', ':= 8)', ':= 8', ':= 6', ':= 8 )', ':= 10', ':= 32']",7,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0)', ':= 8)', ':= 8', ':= 6', ':= 8 )', ':= 10', ':= 32']
*Code:

",['(s1 = s2).'],1,['extensional'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['range 1 to SYNC_MAX_PLUG_SIZE', ':= 2', ':= 4']
*Code:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']

  end process;

",1954,"The provided code is written in VHDL, not Verilog. However, here's how assertions could be written in VHDL:

- [""0"", ""clock"", ""'1'"", ""The clock must start as '1' immediately at the start of the simulation""]
- [""1 ns"", ""clock"", ""'0'"", ""The clock should transition to '0' after 1 ns""]
- [""2 ns"", ""clock"", ""'1'"", ""The clock should transition back to '1' after 2 ns""]

Please note that the timing of assertions in this case refers to simulation time and not clock cycles.

Unfortunately, without any context on the desired behaviour of 'x' and 'last_x', it's virtually impossible to supply valid assertions about their behaviour."

",3424,"Based on the provided VHDL code (which is not Verilog), I cannot provide meaningful assertions, as there are no signals to check against. It consists of a VHDL entity and architecture without external inputs or outputs. 

However, there are a few places where a user might add checks inside the process based on the case statement. Here are two possibilities:

[""immediate"", ""kk"", ""TH"", ""at the case check to ensure kk has initialized correctly as 'TH'""]
[""immediate"", ""k"", 5, ""after 'when \""TH\""' to ensure that k has been correctly set to 5""]

These could be translated into VHDL assertions as below:

assert k = 5 report ""k should be 5 after 'when \""TH\""'"""

","['false', 'false']",2,"[':= 0)', ':= 2']",2,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0)', ':= 2']
*Code:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

However, the same general principle applies - assertions in VHDL are written to check that certain conditions in the code always hold.
Regarding the specific VHDL code provided:
1) It does not include information about the clock or timing, therefore there is nothing to assert about these.
2) The code includes type and signal declarations with no operations where inputs are given and outputs are calculated. Hence, there's no assertion that can be made on the inputs or outputs.
3) Therefore, there's no assertion that can be added to this VHDL code according to the given criteria for generating assertions."

","['NOT( i=5 )', '( i=5 )']",2,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']
*Code:

",3289,"The input provided is VHDL code, not Verilog code and seems to lack varying changes in state or propositions that would require an assertion to verify, especially in terms of clock cycles and state variables. 

Further, it seems to use static integers which can't be inferred from the given input based on typical assertion strategies for Verilog codes. Assertion generation for this input is impossible due to its static nature and lack of state-related variables or potential inconsistencies that would be checked by assertions.

However, since assertions are commonly used in testing to ensure code correctness/executed as expected, and it looks like this code is for testing purposes with pass/fail conditions, from this perspective assertions can possibly be used in the following manner (even though it isn't exactly aligned with Verilog standards, more like VHDL standards):

[""every cycle"", i, 10, ""Variable i should be less than 10 at each clock cycle""]
[""every cycle"", i, 5, ""Exit condition: Variable i should not reach 5""]

As a note, Verilog assertions usually use the 'property' keyword and clock-based events which this code doesn't have, so this attempt to use assertions might not apply directly to this code. But they capture areas that could be asserted given that parts of the code are deterministic and not recursive/no side effects appear. All these assumptions are quite loose as this involves stretching the usage of assertions into this VHDL code."
