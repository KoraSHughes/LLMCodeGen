You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",3330,"It seems there has been a misunderstanding. The provided code and variables are in VHDL, not Verilog. Additionally, your description mentions assertions to be generated based on input and output size, however, the provided code doesn't seem to contain any specific input/output variables or module definition for a digital circuit.

Besides that, VHDL does not use assert statements, it uses REPORT and SEVERITY syntax for error handling and alerting. Therefore, assertions for it would be irrelevant and unusable directly. Verilog, on the other hand, has an ""assert"" keyword for error handling.

Please provide a valid piece of Verilog code along with the variables, inputs, outputs defined and detailed criteria for generating assertions. It would help in generating assertions according to your request."

1) ['5 to 50, k, 0, ""k should be initialized to 0 before starting the loop""]

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

However, assertions can still be developed with a focus on valid input and output sizes. In this case, the inputs and outputs of the instantiated pdp11_tmu entity are key to the assertions:

Here is the a potential list of assertions from the actual input:
[['= 13', ENAPIN, 13, ""ENAPIN should be initialized to 13""],
[CLK, None, None, ""CLK should not be None, it is the input clock signal""],

Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",3332,"Since the provided code is VHDL and not Verilog, it's impossible to provide assertions in Verilog specific format. However, using the VHDL language for design assertions ('assert' statement), we could check variables as follows:

['0', 'V', 'BOOLEAN array of size 5', ""The variable V should be a BOOLEAN array of size 5""]
['0', 'k', 'integer', ""The variable k should be an integer""]
['0', 'k', '0', ""Initial value of variable 'k' should be 0""]

Equivalent VHDL assertions would be:
assert V'length = 5 report ""The variable V should be a BOOLEAN array of size 5"";
assert k'high = integer'high and k'low = integer'low report ""The variable k should be an integer"";
assert k = 0 report ""k should be initialized to 0"";"

","['false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false']",6,['or'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

2) [reset, None, None, ""Check that the reset signal is initialized to its default value at the beginning""]

The reset signal is used to reset the state of the system. This check is important to ensure that the reset is initially set as designated.

3) [sim_done, None, None, ""Check that the simulation is done when the 'sim_done' signal is high""]

The 'sim_done' signal indicates that the simulation is complete. This assertion checks to make sure this signal is behaving as expected.

4) [status, ""00000000"", None, ""Check that the status is initially set to the default value""]

The status is a binary signal indicating the state of the simulation. This assertion checks that it is initially set to the correct default value.

5) [status, ""1"", None, ""Check that status changes to 1 when data mismatch is found""]

This checks that the status signal correctly identifies when there is a data mismatch.

6) [status, ""1"", None, ""Check that status changes to 1 during empty flag mismatch/timeout""]

This assertion checks that the status signal correctly identifies an empty flag mismatch or timeout.

7) [status, ""1"", None, ""Check that status changes to 1 during full flag mismatch/timeout""]

This assertion checks that the status signal correctly identifies a full flag mismatch or timeout.

Remember, these are just estimations. The specific protocol of the system, as well as the syntax of the programming language, may affect which assertions are valid and how you should write them."

",['false'],1,"[':= dbits + 18', ':= 8', ':= 32)']",3,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= dbits + 18', ':= 8', ':= 32)']
*Code:

Since Verilog doesn't natively support assertions like these, to perform these checks you might need to implement some custom code or use a testing suite which supports the Verilog system functions (like $monitor, $display, or $stop).

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['', 'range lowb to highb', 'range lowb_i2 to highb_i2', 'variable', 'range <>', ':= 8.0', ':= 0.0', ':= 1.0', ':= 5', ':= 1000', ':= 1', ':= -100', ':= 2 ns', ':= 1000.0', ':= 80.0', ':= 0', ':= highb', 'range <>) of st_int1', ':= lowb', ':= 1 ns']
*Code:

",3415,"Given that the provided code is VHDL, not verilog, we'll have to adjust accordingly. However, due to the nature of this VHDL program, we can't generate assertions for this code using the standard assertions guidelines and format provided, which apply mainly to Verilog code. In VHDL, assertion syntax, as well as the notion of time (unlike clock cycles in Verilog), are different.

Furthermore, this VHDL code is not using any clock signal. To create some kind of assertion, we could introduce assertions that check if the variables k, m, and n have expected values based on the ""delay"" variable. For instance, we might check if ""k"" is actually 1 when ""delay"" is 1, which would look like this in VHDL:

assert delay = 1 and k = 1
report ""k is not 1 when delay is 1""
severity ERROR; 

Similar assertions could be made for m and n. 

Also, the provided VHDL examples of assertions used to report pass and fail results, can be considered as very basic assertions as they are driven by an unchanging process and do not depend on any variable values or dynamic situations."

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;

property pr1;

endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0 ps', 'constant Twdatahold : time := 2 ns', ':= 6 * Tcyc', 'constant Twdatasu   : time := 6 ns', ':= 40000 ps', 'variable wrlastev', ':= 16)', 'constant Tpulsemin  : time := 2 * Tcyc', ':= 9', 'violation!"" severity error', ':= Tcyc']
*Code:

","['found;', 'found_len = 2;']",2,[')'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:

",4245,"This code seems to be written in VHDL instead of Verilog and does not follow the format specified in the question, which makes it impossible to generate assertions in the required format. Assertions as required are typically not implemented in VHDL code. 

However, if guidelines were to be proposed for future assertions, it would be required to verify that:
- the procedure SCAN is able to take in all necessary input 
- the outputs FOUND and FOUND_LEN are of the correct size 

But again, the task cannot be properly executed as the code is not written in Verilog and does not follow the format presented in the question. VHDL code assertions and Verilog code assertions differ significantly and aren't interchangable."

",['(addr_i < els_p)'],1,['unused = reset_i'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

","['NOT(k=5)', '(k=5)']",2,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']

",3416,"The provided code appears to be in VHDL, not Verilog. These are two different hardware description languages with different syntax and structure. This also doesn't provide any specifics about the timing or clock cycles used in the design, which seems to be an essential part of the task. You may need to provide equivalent material in the Verilog language for further assistance. 

However, from the current understanding, the following assertions might be relevant in a translated Verilog environment:

1) ['Initial', m, 10*A, ""m should be initialized to 10 A""]
2) ['Initial', k, 0, ""k should be initialized to 0""]
3) ['After assignment', k, [0,5], ""k should only be 0 or 5 after assignment in IF clause""]
4) ['After assignment', m, 1*B, ""m should be 1 B when k is assigned 5""]

Please note that these assertions are conceptual and would need to be properly structured and formatted in a Verilog environment with system functions like $assert."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0', 'range 1 to 32 := 1', 'range 1 to 32 := 1)', 'range 1 to 32 := 32', 'range 0 to 15 := 0', 'range 0 to 1  := 0', 'range 0 to 1  := 1', 'range 1 to 7  := 1', 'range 0 to NTECH := 0']
*Code:

",7905,"Based on provided Verilog code, it is noticed that it contains generic inputs and outputs but no specific functions or operations on them that would require assertions for functional correctness.

However, assertions can still be made based on the range of the input variables provided.

Here are the assertions based on the data range:

[apbi_paddr, 0, 31, ""The apbi_paddr should be between 0 and 31 inclusive""]
[apbi_pwdata, 0, 31, ""The apbi_pwdata should be between 0 and 31 inclusive""]
[apbo_prdata, 0, 31, ""The apbo_prdata should be between 0 and 31 inclusive""]
[slvsel, 0, slvselsz-1, ""The slvsel should be between 0 and (slvselsz-1) inclusive""]
[slvselsz, 1, 32, ""The slvselsz should be between 1 and 32 inclusive""]
[slvselen, 0, 1, ""The slvselen should be between 0 and 1 inclusive""]
[tech, 0, NTECH, ""The tech should be between 0 and NTECH inclusive""]
[fdepth, 1, 7, ""The fdepth should be between 1 and 7 inclusive""]
[oepol, 0, 1, ""The oepol should be between 0 and 1 inclusive""]
[odmode, 0, 1, ""The odmode should be between 0 and 1 inclusive""]
[automode, 0, 1, ""The automode should be between 0 and 1 inclusive""]
[acntbits, 1, 32, ""The acntbits should be between 1 and 32 inclusive""]
[aslvsel, 0, 1, ""The aslvsel should be between 0 and 1 inclusive""]
[twen, 0, 1, ""The twen should be between 0 and 1 inclusive""]
[maxwlen, 0, 15, ""The maxwlen should be between 0 and 15 inclusive""] 

It is important to note that the actual values for these variables are subject to the requirements of the application and the environment. Therefore, these assertions are based purely on the coding input and output constraints."

",3919,"The given code seems to be VHDL instead of Verilog. This bot is currently designed only to generate assertions for Verilog code.

Despite this, here are some considerations in case it may support VHDL assertions in the future:

- Check if variable 'I' is incremented properly and doesn't exceed the specified limit (15 in this case).
- Assert that variables 'A' and 'B' got assigned with '1'
- Assert that 'STARTED' is initially FALSE, and then becomes TRUE after the first pass.

A possible format could be:

[['TESTING', 'STARTED', False, ""The process hasn't started yet""],
 ['TESTING', 'I', range(0,16), ""I should not exceed 15""],
 ['ASSIGN_PROCESS', 'A', '1', ""A should be assigned to '1'""],
 ['ASSIGN_PROCESS', 'B', '1', ""B should be assigned to '1'""],

1) [':= 0.0', k, real, ""k should always be a real number""]
2) [':= 5.5', m, real, ""m should always be a real number""]

","['false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false']",7,['or'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['or']
*Code:

",['runner.exit_without_errors;'],1,"['range <>) of phase_locks_unresolved_t', 'range <>) of runner_phase_unresolved_t', 'range <>) of boolean']",3,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['range <>) of phase_locks_unresolved_t', 'range <>) of runner_phase_unresolved_t', 'range <>) of boolean']
*Code:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['write(tmp_line', ':= 3', ':= 1', ':= 0', ':= 2']
*Code:

1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Example Input:

*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;

Example Output:

Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]

 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= CFG_FABTECH', ':= CFG_PCLOW', ':= CFG_PADTECH', ':= CFG_MEMTECH', ':= CFG_CLKTECH', ':= CFG_DISAS', ':= CFG_DUART']
*Code:
