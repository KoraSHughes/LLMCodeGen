You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['<= g_seed', ""<=  reg(reg'high-1 downto 0) & '1'"", ""<= reg(reg'high-1 downto 0) & new_bit"", "": std_logic_vector(g_polynom'length-1 downto 0)"", ""<= (reg(reg'high-1 downto 0) & '0') xor c_poly""]

",4970,"Given that there are no Boolean variables, we cannot assert a value of True or False in Verilog as the language is used for circuit simulations rather than Boolean assertions. 

Moreover, the provided Verilog code is more complex and more related to the total functionality of the code unit than individual input or output assertions. It includes conditional assignments, combinational circuit definitions, and clock signals, which do not lend themselves to assertions in the traditional sense.

It proves challenging to generate assertions for your code because it is written in Coq, a formal proof management system, not in Verilog, a hardware description language. Please provide valid Verilog code, and I'd be more than happy to help you set assertions for it."

",['FALSE'],1,"['nt.""']",1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:

",['FALSE'],1,[':= 3 ns'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

[':= 3 ns']

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

",3759,"Given the provided code snippet, there seems to be a misunderstanding. It appears that the code you've provided isn't written in the Verilog hardware description language - it's actually a test suite written in VHDL, another hardware description language. However, based on the criteria mentioned before (which are somewhat specific to Verilog), it's difficult to define equivalent VHDL assertions. In VHDL, we would use several 'assert' commands as part of regular code to enforce some conditions, rather than defining properties and sequences as done in Verilog's SVA extension. If you are interested in VHDL assertions, please adjust the conditions and provide more information about types of the variables, as without this information it is impossible to create meaningful assertions."

",5272,"Due to the given format of the variables ('', ')', ':= 0'), the providing of specific assertions based on the given criteria appears impractical. However, considering the code provided, the following assertions can be made:

1) ['*', 'F3', (('0', 'integer'), ('15', 'integer')), ""F3 should accept integers ranging from 0 to 15 as these are the values it is compared with in the code""]
Reason: The code includes checks for F3 with indices ranging from 0 to 15. Therefore, it is mandatory for F3 to accept integers within this range as inputs.

2) ['*', 'F1', 'integer', ""F1 should be an integer as it is assigned integer values in the code""]
Reason: F1 is assigned the integer values 3 and 11 in the code. Hence, it should be capable of holding integer values.

3) ['*', 'scalar_complex()', 'time_cons_vectorofvector', ""The scalar_complex() function's return type should be 'time_cons_vectorofvector'""]
Reason: The scalar_complex() function's return value is assigned to the signal 'S1' which is of the type 'time_cons_vectorofvector'.

4) ['*', 'S1', 'time_cons_vectorofvector', ""S1 should be of the type 'time_cons_vectorofvector' as it is assigned the return value of the scalar_complex() function""]
Reason: The variable 'S1' is assigned the return value of the scalar_complex() function. As the return type of this function is 'time_cons_vectorofvector', 'S1' should also be of this type.
  
5) ['*', 'SS', 'integer', ""SS should be integer as it is assigned integer values""]
Reason: SS is initialized to 0 and hence it should be capable of holding integer values.

6) ['*', 'S3', 'integer', ""S3 should be integer as it is assigned integer values""]
Reason: S3 signal is assigned integer value in the code, hence it should be capable of holding integer values. Thus, assertions on the types and ranges of these variables can be employed to ensure correct program operation."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:

",4488,"As the provided code is a VHDL code snippet and not Verilog code, and VHDL can lack certain assertion functionalities compared to Verilog, the following return will be based on the available features and characteristics of VHDL. Here are the appropriate assertions:

1) ['INITIALIZATION', FT, 'INTEGER', 'File type should be of INTEGER']
- In VHDL, it's important to ascertain that the file type 'FT' is valid. This assertion could be made during file declaration, and although not directly possible within VHDL, it ensures that the file can handle integers which will be read from it.

2) ['1', FILEV, 'read_mode', 'File should be in read mode']
- Similarly to the file type assertion, this checks that the 'FILEV' is in 'read_mode'. However, assert statements in VHDL can't be used for this condition since these conditions are checked during compilation and not runtime.

3) ['LOOPING', VAR, CON, 'VAR should be equal to CON in each iteration']
- This assertion would be theoretically checked during each loop iteration in the 'TESTING' process. This is used to verify that the value read from the file 'FILEV' into 'VAR' is equal to the constant 'CON'.

4) ['END OF LOOP', ENDFILE(FILEV), TRUE, 'File should have reached its end at the end of the loop']
- Another assertion that can be done at the end of the loop process to make sure all the data from 'FILEV' has been read.

Please note that adding these assertions isn't straightforward in the provided VHDL code and might require significant changes in the code design or modeling methodology. They are more of theoretical assertions that one must assure in the code but cannot be added directly in the form of assert statements."

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:

2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:

",['false'],1,"[':= log2(NINP)', ':= 1', ':= 100 ns', ':= 8']",4,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= log2(NINP)', ':= 1', ':= 100 ns', ':= 8']
*Code:

",7694,"Based on the given Verilog code, we can assert the following:

8) [ccount, None, None, ""Cycles (represented by ccount) should be incremented properly with each clock pulse.""] 

Note:
- These assertions assume that the clock cycles are ideal and the timing checks are done based on trip points. Timing may need to be adjusted based on the actual design specifications.
- Different variables taken into account for generating these assertions include clock (ClkxC), reset (RstxRB), selection lines (SelxS), Input (In0xD to In7xD), output (OutxD), simulation control variables (tbStatus, ccount), etc.
- For more precise design compliance, model-specific assertions may be necessary, and these would require more intimate knowledge of the design's expected behavior."

",['false'],1,"[':= 8', ':= 100 ns', ':= 1', ':= ENGN_CFGLEN', ':= (CFGWIDTH-1)/SLCWIDTH+1', ':= 10']",6,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 8', ':= 100 ns', ':= 1', ':= ENGN_CFGLEN', ':= (CFGWIDTH-1)/SLCWIDTH+1', ':= 10']

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;

Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

","['false report ""simulation ended"" severity failure;']",1,"[':= 0', ':= 10 ns']",2,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0', ':= 10 ns']
*Code:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

1. STATE SPACE

  Since the values of data inputs have little influence on the functioning 
  of DUT, they are kept constant and not varied. The select input should be 
  a one hot code and is varied from 00..1 to 10..0.

2. PARAMETERIZATION

  The parameter WIDTH_P is the width of the data input and ELS_P is the 
  number of inputs to the mux which in this case is equal to the width of the 
  select input. Since the DUT deals with the data inputs of different widths 
  similarly, an arbitrary set of tests that include edge cases would suffice. 
  So a minimum set of tests might be WIDTH_P = 1,2,3,4 and ELS_P = 2,3,4.

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",3177,"Based on the provided Verilog code example, we are unable to generate a list of assertions as it is in VHDL code, not Verilog. Furthermore, VHDL does not support the type of assertions generally used in Verilog. However, the corresponding kind of checks in VHDL would be included in the testbench code instead of the module file. These checks typically check that the output from a module or function is as expected based on the provided input. In this example, no testbench exists to generate such checks. 

If this was a Verilog code and we had an actual process or function included in the code, we could generate assertions for variables and process inputs and outputs. However, the given code is not applicable for generating such assertions. 

Please provide a Verilog code in order for the bot to generate accurate assertions."

",3287,"The provided Verilog code does not contain any assertion for variables or outputs. It includes an architecture of an empty entity and a process testing about the variable ""x"". The output will not change if there is a variation in ""x"" between 2 to 3 or other values because the assigned value for ""x"" is 1 and never changes, so there is not much to provide meaningful assertions. 

Based on the variables used in this example, it is difficult to create assertions as there is no output variable or function to check against, and also no timing or clock signal defined. In the typical use of Assertions in Verilog, we need at least input variables, output variables and a clock signal to check the output at the positive or negative edge of the clock, which are not available in the given requirements.

Given all these constraints, there are no valid assertions that can be created for this piece of code."

",['FALSE'],1,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']

",3052,"The code provided is actually not written in Verilog, but in VHDL, therefore it's not applicable for me to write Verilog assertions. Assertions require signals which can change over time, and this code lacks it. Also, it seems to be a test code, where errors are reported, but there's nothing to assert against. 

In conclusion, I cannot create assertions for this code."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 10000000', ':= 1', ':= 0', ':= 0 ns', ':= 1 ns']
*Code:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:

2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:

 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None

Example Output:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:

*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;

Example Output:

Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",4385,"As per the given Verilog code and the constraints, following are the assertions that can be made:

1) [""clk_period"", 'clk', '1', ""Clock should be high after 'clk_period'""]
   This assertion is based on the clock process definitions where the 'clk' signal is set to high after every 'clk_period'.

2) [""clk_period"", 'clk', '0', ""Clock should be low after 'clk_period'""]
   This assertion is also based on the clock process definitions where the 'clk' signal is set to low after every 'clk_period'.

3) [""10*clk_period"", 'enc', '0', ""enc should be set to low after 10*clk_period as it's used for encryption""]
   This assertion can be made from the stim_proc process where 'enc' signal is set to low for encryption.

4) [""10*clk_period"", 'rst', '1', ""The system should be reset after 10*clk_period""]
   This assertion is also made from the stim_proc process where 'rst' signal is set to high for reset.

5) [""4*64*clk_period"", None, None, ""report ENCRYPT ERROR (v_0)""]
   This assertion can be created by checking the status of system at every '4*64*clk_period' during the encryption process.

6) [""4*64*clk_period"", None, None, ""report DECRYPT ERROR (v_0)""]
   This assertion is similar to the earlier one but during the decryption process.

7) [""10*clk_period"", 'enc', '1', ""enc should be set to high after 10*clk_period as it's used for decryption""]
   This assertion can be made from the stim_proc process where 'enc' signal is set to high for decryption.

8) ['block_in', 'X""bbbbbbbb"" & X""aaaaaaaa""', 'X""fe2d9913"" & X""3a53039a"" ', ""block_in should switch between encryption and decryption codes, after encryption it should switch to decryption""]
   This assertion can be generated by checking if 'block_in' switches between encryption and decryption code text correctly.

9) ['key', 'X""44444444"" &  X""33333333"" & X""22222222"" &  X""11111111""', None, ""key should remain constant throughout the encryption-decryption process""]
   This assertion can be generated by verifying that 'key' variable remains constant throughout the encryption-decryption process."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 66']

",3498,"There seems to be a confusion here as the actual input code provided is VHDL, not Verilog. Moreover, the method of adding assertions is different in VHDL than it is in Verilog, so the VHDL code can't be analyzed exactly as per the given parameters. However, if we assume the code is VHDL and generate assertions based on VHDL, the assertions might be:

[1, V2(i), V0, ""V2(i) should be equal to V0 at the first ns when i equals V2's left limit""]
[1, V2(i), V2(i-1), ""V2(i) should be taking the value from its previous index at each ns after the first""] 

Please provide valid Verilog code for accurate assertions under Verilog."
