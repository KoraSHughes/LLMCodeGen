You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

sequence sr1;

Example Output:

Which would be the same as adding the assertion:

",['(tech /= easic45) and (tech /= easic90)'],1,"[':= 0)', ':= 0']",2,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0)', ':= 0']

--! @brief Contains the entity and architecture of the 
--! Single Port Block RAM needed to load either the boot
--! loader, jumper loader, or the main application.
-------------------------------------------------------

library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.std_logic_unsigned.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;
use work.main_pack.all;
use work.jump_pack.all;
use work.boot_pack.all;

--! The Single Port BRAM is effectively defined as an array the 
--! compiler can infer as Block RAM. This methodology is useful for verification
--! purposes since the contents of the array can be observed while in simulation.
--! Moreover, binary can be loaded into the BRAM during static elaboration prior
--! to synthesis, allowing the BRAM to be initialized with a bootloader application
--! for hardware deployment.
--!
--! One out of three types of binary can be statically loaded into the BRAM. The first
--! of which is the Jump binary, whose purpose is to make the Plasma-SoC's CPU jump
--! to a particular place in memory. The Jump binary was made so that the Bootloader
--! binary can be bypassed in simulation, allowing the Main binary to begin its execution
--! faster. The second binary is the Bootloader. The purpose of the Bootloader is to load
--! the Main application into memory and then cause the CPU to jump to the starting address
--! of the Main application. Finally, the Main binary is the application under test. Unlike
--! the Jump and Boot binaries, the Main binary can be located at an address other than 0 if
--! compiled and linked correctly. The Jump and Bootloader binaries need to be built such that
--! they are aware where the Main binary is located and needs to go, respectively.
--!
--! Alternatively, the BRAM can be initialized to zero; in other words, without any binary.
--!
--! It is recommended to read over the documentation presented in the corresponding C sources 
--! to learn more about these applications.

--! @author Andrew Powell
--! @date March 14, 2017
--! @brief Contains the entity and architecture of the 
--! Single Port Block RAM needed to load either the boot
--! loader, jumper loader, or the main application.
-------------------------------------------------------

library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.std_logic_unsigned.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;
use work.main_pack.all;
use work.jump_pack.all;
use work.boot_pack.all;

--! The Single Port BRAM is effectively defined as an array the 
--! compiler can infer as Block RAM. This methodology is useful for verification
--! purposes since the contents of the array can be observed while in simulation.
--! Moreover, binary can be loaded into the BRAM during static elaboration prior
--! to synthesis, allowing the BRAM to be initialized with a bootloader application
--! for hardware deployment.
--!
--! One out of three types of binary can be statically loaded into the BRAM. The first
--! of which is the Jump binary, whose purpose is to make the Plasma-SoC's CPU jump
--! to a particular place in memory. The Jump binary was made so that the Bootloader
--! binary can be bypassed in simulation, allowing the Main binary to begin its execution
--! faster. The second binary is the Bootloader. The purpose of the Bootloader is to load
--! the Main application into memory and then cause the CPU to jump to the starting address
--! of the Main application. Finally, the Main binary is the application under test. Unlike
--! the Jump and Boot binaries, the Main binary can be located at an address other than 0 if
--! compiled and linked correctly. The Jump and Bootloader binaries need to be built such that
--! they are aware where the Main binary is located and needs to go, respectively.
--!
--! Alternatively, the BRAM can be initialized to zero; in other words, without any binary.
--!
--! It is recommended to read over the documentation presented in the corresponding C sources 
--! to learn more about these applications.

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;

endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:

2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['nt']

",5841,"Based on the provided Verilog code, you could implement the following assertions:

1) [None, BYTEV1, 8, ""BYTEV1 should always have a size of 8""]
2) [None, BYTEV2, 8, ""BYTEV2 should always have a size of 8""]
3) [None, NIBV1, 4, ""NIBV1 should always have a size of 4""]

Please note that this is not a Verilog code but a VHDL one. So, the concept of assertion may vary from language to language. Also note that assertions concept in VHDL is different from the one in Verilog and assertions are mainly used to validate outputs, inputs and the internal states of a design during simulation. Therefore, the assertions provided will not translate directly into VHDL code but they describe the intent for these signals."

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= minimum(t1', ':= abs (t1 - t2)', ':= t1 + t2', ':= maximum(t1', ':= 2 sec']
*Code:

entity ent is

		t2 : time := 5 sec
	);

",4059,"I'm sorry but there seems to be a miscommunication. The provided code is written in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) not Verilog. They are different hardware description languages used to model digital systems. 

Also, variable names given do not match with any used within the VHDL code. 

However, generating inferences for the VHDL files we can still provide certain assertions:
- For 'g1' variable in both entities its type and size is integer which is correct, as this code is using it for arithmetic and comparison operations
- 'g1' variable is used accurately inside the block of both entities 

If these were the variables to be considered as inputs/outputs for this design, based on this we could generate two example assertions as:
1. [every cycle, g1, integer, ""g1 should be an integer value""]
2. [every cycle, g1, None, ""g1 is a generic input integer to testbench""]

But these assumes that 'g1' is central to your description of required assertions."

","['false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false']",6,['or'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['or']

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['range -10 ns to 10 ns', 'range <>', ':= 9', 'range 0.0 to 1.0)', 'range <>) of integer']
*Code:

",3961,"Since there seems to be some confusion in the communication and your code does not quite follow the format you've mentioned initially, there's a discrepancy as the provided code is actually written in VHDL and not in Verilog. There are no specific timing or clock signals defined in the code, and therefore, it's difficult to generate assertions based on a clock cycle.

However, based on the defined variables and given code, we can suggest following assertions:

[""slice_8a"", ""int_8"", None, ""slice_8a should be a subtype int_8 array""]
[""slice_8b"", ""int_8"", None, ""slice_8b should be a subtype int_8 array""]
[""target_1"", ""BOOLEAN"", None, ""target_1 should be of BOOLEAN type""]
[""target_2"", ""BOOLEAN"", None, ""target_2 should be of BOOLEAN type""]
[""target_3"", ""BOOLEAN"", None, ""target_3 should be of BOOLEAN type""]
[""target_4"", ""BOOLEAN"", None, ""target_4 should be of BOOLEAN type""]

Please note, assertions in VHDL are generally used to check for functional correctness and are defined within the process not as separate entities. For a more comprehensive VHDL assertion generation, more specific details about the functional operation would be needed."

","['false report ""synram_dp: technology "" & tech_table(tech) &']",1,"[':= 0', ':= 6', ':= 8 )']",3,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0', ':= 6', ':= 8 )']
*Code:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;

Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",['FALSE'],1,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",['read_data_cmp = output.data;'],1,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']
*Code:

",3053,"The given code is not Verilog, it's VHDL. In the provided VHDL code there are no assertion condition, it seems to be just the definition of an entity and its architecture with a signal 'err' defined but not used. Assertions cannot be defined without actual logic to verify or check. The 'err' signal that is defined is not used, and thus a useful assertion can't be made.

However, assuming you want assertions assuming the signal 'err' should always be null, here they could look something like:
- ['1', 'err', 'null', ""err should always be null""]

This would correspond to:
- assert (err = null) report ""Error: err signal should always be null."" severity FAILURE;

Please remember this is not good practice, as the 'err' signal has no real use or conditions that are affecting it. Assertions should be used to verify the functionality or conditions expected in your design."

",3368,"Since there are no events or clocks in the provided Verilog code, it's not possible to provide any assertions based on timing. Similarly, there are no procedures or functions that use the assertion constructs of SystemVerilog.

Here are two possible ""assertions"" in a more general sense, although they do not meet your specified format:

[None, ""global_int"", 10, ""global_int should end up being 10 after Recursive_subr procedure""]
[None, ""Recursive_subr input"", 10, ""Recursive_subr should be able to accept input of 10""]

In conclusion, making concrete assertions for the given VHDL code is not feasible because it lacks the required constructs like timing, clocks, procedures, and functions for the assertion generation. The entity (c02s02b00x00p07n01i02932ent) doesn't have any inputs or outputs and  doesn't interact with any other modules or signals."

The code you are asking me to analyze is written in VHDL, a hardware description language used in electronic design automation to describe digital and mixed-signal systems.

Since my capabilities are restricted and not designed to interpret VHDL, I am unable to assist you in generating assertions for it.

My apologies for this inconvenience, and I'm looking forward to helping you with any Python-related inquiries."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

",['FALSE'],1,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:

",4851,"The given Verilog code doesn't provide any obvious places for assertions. The inputs and outputs of the function are not directly clear from the code. However, we can assert that the file reading happens successfully and the comparison operation between `v` and `C57` is operational. Note that these are inferred assertions, and a direct technical approach may not find any assertion to be made. Here are some possible assertions:

1) [""AFTER READ"", len, 8, ""len should be 8 after reading from file, indicating a successful read""]

2) [""AFTER CHECK"", v, C57, ""v should be equal to C57 after the check, indicating successful comparison""]

Note: These are hypothetical assertions and may not work directly in VHDL code without fitting into proper VHDL syntax."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");
