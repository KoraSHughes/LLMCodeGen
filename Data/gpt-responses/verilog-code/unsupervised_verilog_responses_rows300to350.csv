You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:

*Code:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",['now - last_clk_edge_time >= Thold_d_clk'],1,"['violation""', ':= 0 fs']",2,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['violation""', ':= 0 fs']

","['false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false', 'false']",6,['or'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

 * ============================================
 *
 * Supports
 *   - credit flow-control
 *   - stop/go style flow-control
 * 
 * Credit Counter Optimization (for credit-based flow-control)
 * ===========================
 * 
 * optimized_credit_counter = 0 | 1
 * 
 * Set to '1' to move credit counter logic to start of next clock cycle.
 * Remove add/sub from critical path.
 * 
 * To move add/sub logic we buffer the last credit rec. and the any
 * flit sent on the output.

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 1', ':= 0', ':= 0     -- 1 = first word fall trough mode', ':= 100', ':= 10', ':= 32']

",5454,"As a helpful bot, I noticed that the provided code is in VHDL, not Verilog. Therefore, adding assertions following the Verilog syntax or conventions might not work effectively. Also, the conversion from VHDL to Verilog would be a complex task, and out of scope of this task. 

If we were to work solely with VHDL, assertions could be added in the following manner:

1. Assert the 'clk' signal is toggling every 'clkperiod/2'
2. Assert that the data bus doesn't exceed 31 bits (corresponding to a width of 32 bits)
3. Assert that the address line doesn't exceed 26 bits (corresponding to a width of 27 bits)
4. Assert that technology configuration variables (i.e., fabtech, memtech, padtech, clktech) are within acceptable ranges.

However, adding these as a direct list as per the original approach would not be appropriate as difference in code syntax and style of VHDL and Verilog. Further, the program provided descriptions that would not fit in a line, involving complex digital entities and simulated environments. 

To provide optimal help, the actual code(not vague descriptions) along with specific requirements for assertions and code in context would be beneficial and produce effective results."

",4746,"Based on the given Verilog code, it is unusual and difficult to construct assertions given that there are no obvious outcomes or noteworthy variables. The 'he' and ':= 0' variable expressions described are not seen in the provided code snippet as well. 

Assuming 'ShouldBeTime' and 'A' are our subject_variable and target respectively based on their frequency of use in the code, a potential assertion could be akin to:

['ShouldBeTime', 'A', None, ""Ensure that A produces an event after the assigned time""] 

However, it should be noted that without a better understanding of the variables and code's function, this assertion could be incorrect or insufficient. Additionally, regular assertions aren't commonly used in VHDL like they are in other programming languages like Python, making this even more challenging."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;

Example Output:

Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']
*Code:

",3337,"It seems there might have been a confusion with the language. The provided code is not written in Verilog, but instead in VHDL which is a different hardware description language. Nevertheless, the approach to providing assertions would be similar once the language syntax is observed.

VHDL doesn't have an assertion structure exactly similar to what you described. However, we can make use of the assert statement in VHDL which causes a runtime error if the condition asserted is false. Here is the proper declarations for VHDL:

[':= 0', 'integer := 7, k := 0', 'm', 'm must always be within the range of standard integer data type which is -2**31 to (2**31)-1 to avoid underflow/overflow']
[':= 0','integer := 7, k := 0','k', 'k must always be within the range of standard integer data type which is -2**31 to (2**31)-1 to avoid underflow/overflow']

Please note that the target here is None, as VHDL doesn't provide a mechanism for dynamic size checking on basic types like integer.
  
These would translate into VHDL assert statements like:
assert m >= -2**31 and m <= (2**31)-1 report ""m must always be within the range"" severity failure;
assert k >= -2**31 and k <= (2**31)-1 report ""k must always be within the range"" severity failure;"

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['[els_p-1:0] ra_one_hot1 = (r1_v_i << r1_addr_i)', '[els_p-1:0] wa_one_hot = (w_v_i << w_addr_i)', '[els_p-1:0] ra_one_hot0 = (r0_v_i << r0_addr_i)']

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 4*OUTPUT_NIBBLES / DATA_WIDTH', ':= 0', 'range 0 to NUM_CHUNKS := 0', ':= 2']
*Code:

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= 0']

",4556,"The provided VHDL code doesn't seem to be related to assertions per se and doesn't provide enough information to form any substantial assertions, as there are no inputs or outputs identified and the code is mainly comments and licenses. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an assertion list based on it.

Here is a hypothetical scenario to create some assertions if there were identified inputs and outputs:

Assuming that the constants, variables and bit_vectors in the code were the inputs and outputs, we might specify assertions such as:
[['TESTING', 'CON', 'BIT_VECTOR5', ""Constant 'CON' should match the type 'BIT_VECTOR5'""],
 ['TESTING', 'VAR', 'BIT_VECTOR5', ""Variable 'VAR' should match the type 'BIT_VECTOR5'""],
 ['TESTING', 'k', 'integer', ""'k' should be an integer""],
 ['TESTING', 'ENDFILE(FILEV)', True, ""At the end of the file, 'ENDFILE(FILEV)' should be True""]]

However, this is more Specman-like E language than Verilog (or SystemVerilog) and would not apply to a typical Verilog scenario. 

Assertions in Verilog are typically used to validate the functionality of a design in simulation by checking if certain conditions hold true during simulation. For example, one might check that a certain signal is high during a clock cycle or that a sequence of events occurs within a certain timeframe. There does not appear to be a need for such checks in the provided code."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

2) ['k', 1, None, ""The variable k should be set to 1 when any error or discrepancy is encountered""]
3) ['VAR', CON, None, ""The read variable VAR should always match the constant CON""] 

These assertions would correspond to the following VHDL assertions:

3) assert VAR = CON report ""The read variable VAR should always match the constant CON"";

",4548,"This code doesn't have obvious points for assertions since there aren't any dedicated inputs or outputs that are changing according to defined conditions. Here are two assertions that can be inferred:

1) Assert that 'sclk' retains its value after the clock cycle. This is based on the stimulus process where the 'sclk' is used but doesn't seem to change its value logically. Hence, it can be asserted to maintain the value.

2) Assert that the width of the 'data' output matches the constant 'data_width'. Within the code, the 'data' signal is sized according to the constant 'data_width'. So, it can be asserted that the size of 'data' matches with 'data_width'.

So the assertions would translate into the following format:

[sclk_period, sclk, sclk, ""Clock 'sclk' should retain its value after the clock cycle""]
[data_width, data, data_width, ""The width of 'data' should match with 'data_width'""]"

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
[':= (6 - 4) * (4 - 4)', ':= (6 - 4) * (3 - 4)', ':= (6 - 4) * (9 - 4)', ':= (6 - 4) * (1 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (1 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (3 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (6 - 4)', ':= (6 - 4) * (5 - 4)', ':= (4 - 4) * (1 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (8 - 4)', ':= (4 - 4) * (7 - 4)', ':= (4 - 4) * (8 - 4)', ':= 4', ':= (4 - 4) * (3 - 4)', ':= (4 - 4) * (5 - 4)', ':= (4 - 4) * (4 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (2 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (4 - 4)', ':= (6 - 4) * (2 - 4)', ':= (6 - 4) * (8 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (5 - 4)', ':= (4 - 4) * (9 - 4)', ':= (4 - 4) * (6 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (9 - 4)', ':= (6 - 4) * (6 - 4)', ':= (6 - 4) * (7 - 4)', ':= (1 - 4) * (7 - 4)', ':= (4 - 4) * (2 - 4)']

",4935,"The provided code is written in Coq, not Verilog, so no Verilog assertions can be added. However, if we were to translate this into a similar task of creating propositions to assert about the Coq functions, we could have:

1) The inductively_barred function must take a list of booleans and a property P, and return a Prop. It should be expected to return a Prop no matter the input, so we can assert:
    [""forall"", [P, l], ""inductively_barred P l"", ""inductively_barred function taking a property P and a boolean list l must return a Prop""]

2) The approx function must take a function X and a list of booleans and return a Prop. Similar to inductively_barred, you could assert:
    [""forall"", [X, l], ""approx X l"", ""approx function taking a function X and a boolean list l must return a Prop""]

3) The barred function must take a property P and return a bool. This could be checked with the following assertion:
    [""forall"", P, ""barred P"", ""barred function taking a property P must return a bool""]

4) The Y function must take a property P and a list of booleans, and return a bool. So we can assert:
    [""forall"", [P, l], ""Y P l"", ""Y function taking a property P and a boolean list l must return a bool""]

This is not a direct mapping from the original prompt, but an adaptation for Coq that respects the general intention of the task. Please note, these statements in the list format do not translate directly to Coq code."

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:

 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:

*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;

property pr1;

endproperty

sequence sr1;

property pr1;

Example Output:

Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");

",1862,"Given the provided code, the system should check the sizes and types of the input and output signals, `a`, `b`, and `c`, as they are passed to the `modulo_test` entity. However, in Verilog, the `assert` keyword is not typically used for this purpose. Instead, `assert` is generally used within `properties` to verify or enforce certain behaviors at runtime. It is quite challenging to construct these assertions with the provided Verilog code. In a real-world scenario, we would need more context and specifics about how these signals are being used within the `modulo_test` entity.

Assuming that a, b, and c are supposed to be integers of a similar width, possible assertions could be:

[""a cycle after a is assigned"", b , a, ""b should have the same value as a one cycle after a is assigned""]
[""a cycle after a is assigned"", c , a, ""c should have the same value as a one cycle after a is assigned""]

These would look like this in Verilog:
```
new_assertions:
  process
  begin
    a <= 7;
    wait for 1 ns;
    assert (b == a) report ""b should have the same value as a one cycle after a is assigned"";
    assert (c == a) report ""c should have the same value as a one cycle after a is assigned"";

    a <= 8;
    wait for 1 ns;
    assert (b == a) report ""b should have the same value as a one cycle after a is assigned"";
    assert (c == a) report ""c should have the same value as a one cycle after a is assigned"";

    a <= -7;
    wait for 1 ns;
    assert (b == a) report ""b should have the same value as a one cycle after a is assigned"";
    assert (c == a) report ""c should have the same value as a one cycle after a is assigned"";
    wait;
  end process;
```
These assertions ensure that b and c always have the same value as a one cycle after a changes its value. Please adjust them according to the actual requirements of your code."

You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['range 0 to 3 := 0', ':= 10 ns']
*Code:

Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:

 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
['range <>', 'range <>) of integer']
*Code:

entity array1 is
end entity;

architecture test of array1 is
    type matrix_t is array (integer range <>, integer range <>) of integer;

    constant c : matrix_t(0 to 1, 0 to 1) := (
        ( 1, 2 ),
        ( 3, 4 ) );
begin

    process is
        variable m : matrix_t(1 to 3, 1 to 3) := (
            ( 1, 2, 3 ),
            ( 4, 5, 6 ),
            ( 7, 8, 9 ) );
    begin
        report integer'image(m(1, 3));
        report integer'image(m(2, 2));
        report integer'image(c(1, 0));


        wait;
    end process;

end architecture;
",2063,"The assertions based on the given input are:

","['NOT(k=5)', '(k=5)']",2,[':= 0'],1,"You are a helpful bot that adds assertions to pieces of Verilog code.
You will be given a string of code presented in the format:
*Variables:
...
*Code:
...
Generate assertions based on the following criteria:
1) Assert that the function can take in all inputs necessary to complete the process
2) Assert that all outputs are of the proper sizes.

Your response should ONLY be a list of assertions in the format:
[timing, subject_variable, target, reasoning]
 -timing is the clock cycle(s) at which the assertion is checked relative to the present cycle
 -subject_variable and target can ONLY be variables present in the code, integers, booleans, or None
 -reasoning is a short decription of why the assertion was made

Here is an example of what your input will look like and what you should return:
Example Input:
*Variables:
[clkstart, pr1, cStart, sr1]
*Code:
assign clkstart = clk && gGate;
sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty

sequence sr1;
    req ##2 gnt;
endsequence

property pr1;
    @(posedge clk) cStart |-> sr1;
endproperty
Example Output:
[clkstart, cStart, sr1, ""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle""]
Which would be the same as adding the assertion:
assert @(posedge clkstart) cStart |-> sr1 else $display(""cStart should be equal to sr1 at the start of every clock cycle"");


Here is the actual input you should provide assertions for:
*Variables:
