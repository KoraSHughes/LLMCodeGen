","The image contains text related to asynchronous FIFO assertions in what looks like a snippet from a book or documentation, along with a portion of Verilog code. However, please note that I am unable to provide information about the ""figure"" associated with this code since the image only contains text and code, and there is no reference to a specific figure or diagram within it. Would you like me to explain or analyze the Verilog code instead?",What is an example of using assertions and properties for checking a FIFO in Verilog?,"This Verilog code snippet contains a cover property, an assertion property, and an initial block that includes some initializations and a loop for testing clock signals and writing/reading operations in a design. The cover property and assert property are used to monitor and check certain conditions, while the initial block sets up the environment for simulation and executes the loop for testing.",Mehta

",The figure associated with the Verilog code present in this image is Figure 4.3.,What is an example of a Verilog sequence and property definition that uses the overlapping implication operator to check a signal 'req' at the same clock edge it was triggered and also checks for another condition after 2 clock cycles?,"This Verilog code defines a sequence `sr1` that waits for two clock cycles after a condition `gnt==1 && req==0` is met. The property `pr1` specifies that the sequence should be found starting from a positive clock edge while `cStart` is true. Lastly, an assertion `reqGnt` is used to check if the property is satisfied and then display a pass or fail message along with the simulation time.",Mehta
