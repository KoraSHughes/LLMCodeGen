An exploration in code & assertion generation with large language models.

Project Abstract:
Software assertions play a critical role in the creation of test benches and the overall verification of systems. In the case of formal property verification, complex design specifications are interpreted by industry experts and translated into System Verilog Assertions (SVA). Recent research has pointed toward large language models as a potential tool for SVA generation, however, lack of data and standardization of software assertions has resulted in mixed results amongst methods of evaluations. Thus, this paper proposes a dataset of code and natural language data containing assertions in SystemVerilog and Python that can be used to train and test future collaborative coding models. Additionally, this paper provides a preliminary analysis
vii and novel schema for the consistent generation of quality software assertions with
OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4.
